# Sales-Performance-and-Supply-Chain-Analysis-for-Syntel-Group
This project involved analyzing Syntel Group of Companies to evaluate Q1 and Q2 2019 sales performance and supply chain metrics. The analysis provides key insights into sales trends, inventory levels, and customer behavior, enabling data-driven decisions for optimizing inventory management and so on

The following insights were uncovered from the analysis:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

**Top Sales Category:** Toys generated the highest sales, with $7,586 in revenue, followed by Electronics at $7,129. Clothing, on the other hand, performed the least in terms of revenue, generating $5,847.

**Sales Channels:** In-store sales dominate the overall performance, accounting for 65.3% of total sales, while online sales contribute only 34.7% to the total revenue.

**Inventory and Sales Correlation:** The inventory levels for all categories (Clothing, Electronics, Home Goods, and Toys) are consistently higher than the quantity sold, indicating a potential overstock situation

**Top Reordering Category:** Home Goods led in reorder frequency, which implies steady demand and possibly a high rate of repeat purchases.

**Warehouse Efficiency:** Warehouse 3 holds the highest inventory levels, particularly for toys and home goods, while Warehouses 4 and 9 are underutilized, with noticeably lower inventory levels.

**Monthly Sales Trends:** March saw a sales peak of $6,471, while sales dipped significantly in February to $4,317, indicating potential seasonal fluctuations in performance.

**Reorder Trends:** Electronics recorded the lowest reorder frequency, which might suggest either low customer retention or potential quality concerns within this category.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Reevaluate the clothing product line and consider promotions, discounts, or introducing trendy items to stimulate demand in this underperforming category.

Continue investing in the online sales channel, as it is the top performer. However, review the in-store strategy to identify potential improvements and boost its contribution.

Review inventory management practices to better align stock levels with demand, reducing overstock and storage costs. This could involve reducing order quantities, improving sales predictions. Additionally, consider monitoring product turnover rates more closely to minimize overstocking.

With underutilized warehouses such as 4 and 9, redistributing inventory across these locations could lead to better storage efficiency. Increasing stock in high-demand locations like Warehouse 3 would ensure that customer needs are met promptly.

To address the low reorder frequency in the electronics category, it's worth gathering customer feedback to identify potential issues with product quality or pricing. Offering bundle deals or extended warranties could also encourage repeat purchases in this category.

Implementing loyalty programs or special offers for high-value customers, such as ID 527, could further increase customer retention. Personalized marketing strategies based on previous purchases could also encourage top customers to continue spending.

Toys have proven to be the most successful category, so expanding the product range within this segment or introducing exclusive items could help maintain and grow its popularity.

Encouraging more customer reviews, especially in the electronics and clothing categories, can help improve trust and sales in these segments. Additionally, investigating low-rated products to address common complaints will be critical for improving overall customer satisfaction.
